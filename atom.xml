Protective CD8 + T cell responses in HSAN-I patient PBMCs and <em>Sptlc2</em>-deficient mice were restored by supplementing with sphingolipids and pharmacologically inhibiting ER stress-induced cell death. Therefore, SPTLC2 underpins protective immunity by translating extracellular stimuli into intracellular anabolic signals and antagonizes ER stress to promote T cell metabolic fitness.</p><p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/04/12/5cb073b2d43d4.jpg" alt></p><h2 id="角质形成细胞介导的TGF-β活化维持皮肤对于记忆性CD8-T-细胞的招募"><a href="#角质形成细胞介导的TGF-β活化维持皮肤对于记忆性CD8-T-细胞的招募" class="headerlink" title="角质形成细胞介导的TGF-β活化维持皮肤对于记忆性CD8 T 细胞的招募"></a>角质形成细胞介导的TGF-β活化维持皮肤对于记忆性CD8 T 细胞的招募</h2><p><a href="https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keratinocyte-Mediated Activation of the Cytokine TGF-β Maintains Skin Recirculating Memory CD8+ T Cells</a>)</p><p>Regulated activation of the cytokine TGF-β by integrins α vβ 6 and α vβ 8 expressed on keratinocytes is required for residence of epidermal-resident memory T cells, but whether skin-derived signals also affect recirculating memory cells in the skin remains unclear.

In mice lacking α vβ 6 and α vβ 8 integrins ( <em>Itgb6</em> −/− <em>Itgb8</em> fl/fl <em>-</em>K14-cre), the absence of epidermal-activated TGF-β resulted in a gradual loss of E- or P-selectin-binding central and peripheral memory populations, which were rescued when skin entry was inhibited. Skin recirculating memory cells were required for optimal host defense against skin VV infection.

However, TGFβ is also the most prominent of the factors within the tumour micro- environment that are known to induce EMT of cancer cells. Before the initiation of cancer, and during the early stages of carcinogenesis, TGFβ probably functions as a tumour suppressor. By contrast, during advanced stages of cancer, TGFβ signalling promotes cancer progression and metastasis.<br><br>In normal tissues, the anti-proliferative and proapoptotic response of epithelial cells to TGFβ might limit the growth of normal epithelium and the emergence of malignant carcinomas. With regard to fibroblasts,TGFβ facilitates fibroblast–epithelial-cell interactions, which further suppress cancer initiation. In advanced cancer, on the other hand, the anti-proliferative effect of TGFβ is progressively lost — instead, it facilitates EMT of cancer cells, potentially promoting invasiveness and metastasis. Signalling pathways that are implicated in TGFβ-mediated EMT involve  <font color="#F08080"><strong>Smad</strong></font> signalling, the <font color="#F08080"><strong>phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase–Akt</strong></font> pathway and signalling through <font color="#F08080"><strong>RHOA</strong></font> and <font color="#F08080"><strong>p38 MAPK</strong></font><p>(其中Smad可能是起决定作用的通路)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/04/12/5cb0937f9bfc0.jpg" alt></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Fibroblasts-in-the-host-defence-against-cancer"><a href="#Fibroblasts-in-the-host-defence-against-cancer" class="headerlink" title="Fibroblasts in the host defence against cancer?"></a>Fibroblasts in the host defence against cancer?</h2><p>Fibroblasts that overexpress TGFβ and HGF promote tumorigenic outgrowth of normal breast epithelium, but such outgrowth is inhibited by ‘normal’ stromal fibroblasts. One possible mechanism for such a function of fibroblasts in host defence is modulation of the immune response. Fibroblasts are a signficant source of immune-modulatory cytokines such as interferon-γ, interleukin-6 and tumour-necrosis factor-α which can influence the mobilization of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and macrophages. In this regard, it has also been suggested that normal fibroblasts help to prevent apoptosis of T cells</p><p>(活化的fibroblast促进癌症，normal fibroblast抑制癌症)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Therapies-to-target-activated-fibroblasts"><a href="#Therapies-to-target-activated-fibroblasts" class="headerlink" title="Therapies to target activated fibroblasts"></a>Therapies to target activated fibroblasts</h2><p>Fibroblast-directed therapy can be envisioned as either ‘to ablate’ or ‘to normalize’ CAFs.

The highest weights can be translated into TF-target regulatory links.</p><p><strong>Input</strong><br>The preferred expression values are gene-summarized counts (which might or might not use unique molecular identifiers, UMI). Other measurements, such as counts or transcripts per million (TPM) and FPKM/RPKM, are also accepted as input. However, note that some authors recommend <strong>avoiding within sample normalization (i.e. TPM) for co-expression analysis because they may induce artificial co-variation</strong></p><p><strong>output</strong><br>The output of GENIE3 is a table with the genes, the potential regulators, and their<br>“importance measure” (IM), which represents the weight that the transcription factor (input gene) has in the prediction of the target.<br> Each gene-set was then split into positive- and negative- correlated targets (i.e. Spearman correlation between the TF and the potential target) to separate likely activated and repressed targets. Finally, only the gene-sets (TF co-expression modules) with <strong>at least 20 genes</strong> were kept for the following step</p><p>Being based only on co-expression, these modules may include many false positives and indirect targets. So <em>RcisTarge</em> was used.</p><h2 id="Use-RcisTarge-to-identify-putative-direct-binding-targets-from-co-expression-module"><a href="#Use-RcisTarge-to-identify-putative-direct-binding-targets-from-co-expression-module" class="headerlink" title="Use RcisTarge to identify putative direct-binding targets from co-expression module"></a>Use <em>RcisTarge</em> to identify putative direct-binding targets from co-expression module</h2><p>Only modules with significant motif enrichment of the correct upstream regulator are retained, and pruned to remove indirect target genes without motif support.<br>Reson:</p><p><strong>Step1</strong><br>It selects DNA motifs that are significantly over-represented in the surroundings of the transcription start site (TSS) of the genes in the gene-set.The motifs that are annotated to the corresponding TF and obtain a Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) &gt; 3.0 are retained. For each species,  two gene-motif rankings (10kb around the TSS or 500bp upstream the TSS), which determine the search space around the transcription start site were used.</p><p><strong>Step2</strong><br>For each motif and gene-set, RcisTarget predicts candidate target genes (i.e. genes in the gene-set that are ranked above the leading edge).</p><blockquote><p>However, in the datasets we analyzed, these modules were less numerous and showed very low motif enrichment, suggesting that these are lower quality modules. For this reason, we finally decided to exclude the detection of direct repression from the workflow, and <strong>continue only with the positive-correlated targets</strong>. </p></blockquote><h2 id="Score-the-activity-of-each-of-these-regulons-in-each-cell-with-AUCell"><a href="#Score-the-activity-of-each-of-these-regulons-in-each-cell-with-AUCell" class="headerlink" title="Score the activity of each of these regulons in each cell with AUCell"></a>Score the activity of each of these regulons in each cell with <em>AUCell</em></h2><p>The relative scores of each regulon across the cells allow identifying which cells have a significantly high sub-network activity. The resulting binary activity matrix can be used as a biological dimensionality reduction for downstream analyses. Since the regulon is scored as a whole, instead of only the TF or individual genes, this approach is robust against drop-outs.</p><p>The input to AUCell is a gene set, and the output the gene set “activity” (AUC) in each cell.</p><p>AUCell calculates the enrichment of the regulon as an area under the recovery curve (AUC) across the ranking of all genes in a particular cell, whereby genes are ranked by their expression value.
